Let me say first a couple of words about myself:
  
  - My name is Eemil Mitikka
  
  - Doctoral Researcher at the University of Helsinki/Aleksanteri Institute
  
  - I study political participation and how it relates to authoritarianism in Russia and post-Soviet countries
  
  - I have background in social sciences and Russian &amp; Eastern European studies
  
  - I also use statistical methods and R in my daily work

Here you can my contact info. Please feel free to contact me through any of these channels. Feel free also to add me as a contact on LinkedIn -- Russia scholars are not a very big group, so it doesn't hurt to have contacts :)

# Answers

#### [Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) of Russia (without Crimea) in 2021 was about 
&amp;#10060; 120 million &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9989; 144 million &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 290 million (population of USSR [in 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Soviet_Union#/media/File:Population_of_former_USSR.PNG))

#### Average [life expectancy]() in Russia in 2021 is about
&amp;#10060; 55 years (in 1949) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 64 years (in 1994) &lt;br&gt;

&amp;#10060; Halved (in ~2013) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; Doubled

???

Here are the correct answers. You can see how well you did!

Some of the answer alternatives very pulled out of hat, but those within brackets are "correct" numbers but in diffent time, for example.

---

#### In 2020, Russia's [GDP per capita](https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#&amp;place=country/RUS&amp;statsVar=Amount_EconomicActivity_GrossDomesticProduction_Nominal_PerCapita) was
&amp;#10060; 3 times bigger than in 2000 (in ~2005) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9989; 6 times bigger than in 2000 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 9 times bigger than in 2000  (in 2013) &lt;br&gt;

#### In 2020, Russia's [military spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) was around 62 billion US$. This is
&amp;#9989;  8% of the U.S. military spending &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 20% of the U.S. military spending &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 30% of the U.S. military spending

#### Share of population [using the Internet](https://ourworldindata.org/internet) in Russia in 2019 was about

&amp;#10060;  53% of Russians &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 73% of Russians &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9989; 83 % of Russians


???

And here are some more answers.

---

#### In 2020, the share of [services](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.SRV.TOTL.ZS?end=2020&amp;locations=RU&amp;start=1989&amp;view=chart) of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) was about

&amp;#10060; 37% of GDP (in 1991) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 45% of GDP (in 1995) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9989; 56% of GDP

#### In 2019, the share [oil rents](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PETR.RT.ZS?locations=RU) of Russia's GDP was about

&amp;#9989; 9% of GDP &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 15% of GDP (in 2000) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; 35% of GDP

#### In 2019, there were 25 [suicides](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.SUIC.P5?locations=RU) per 100,000 people in Russia. This is

&amp;#10060;  Approximately the same figure as in year 2000 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#10060; About one third less compared to year 2000 (in 2011) &lt;br&gt;
&amp;#9989; More than twice less compared to year 2000

Here's a quote from Hans Rosling, who was a Swedish physician, academic and enthusiastic open data promoter.

I think this quote summarizes quite nicely the meaning and importance of numerical data in modern life.

Here's briefly to outline of today's lecture. 

We'll talk first briefly about the Russian survey data because 

  - this might be interesting to some of you
  
  - there are also some myths and misconceptions related to this kind of data
  
  - not very detailed examination of the topic since I believe Margarita Zavadskaya will talk about survey data later on this course
  
Next, I'll say couple of words briefly about the state statistics

Then, I'll say couple of words about international statistics related to Russia

Here's very shortly some historical background for surveys. 

The reason why I mention these things here is that since Russia is non-democratic country with no free press, there are often concerns in both academic and everyday discussions about the reliability and usability of Russian survey data. 

So can we relate to Russian surveys in same way as we relate to surveys conducted in democratic countries?

# Survey data &amp;#128550; &amp;#128577; &amp;#128528; &amp;#128578; &amp;#128522;
.large[
* Reliability concerns in authoritarian countries:
  
  1. .blue[Fake numbers]: political legitimacy questions
  
  2. .blue[Opinion manipulation]: state controls the main communication means
  
  3. .blue[Social desirability bias]; survey respondents hide their true opinions when answering
  
]

???

Most typically, the critique of Russian surveys comes in three forms: 

  1. Fake numbers: Russian polling agencies simply present fake numbers to bolster the legitimacy of Putin, the Kremlin and other similar power structures
  
  2. Opinion manipulation: this line of critique suggests that since there is no free media in Russia, the Kremlin can mold the opinion climate through media
  
  3. Social desirability bias: this means that Russians fear the social consequences for expressing their "true opinions", so they simply lie or embellish the truth when answering the surveys

.moderate["An .blue[opinion poll can only be conducted in a democracy with a free press]. In a country with no free press [...] when a pollster phones people up and asks, 'Hello, do you approve of Vladimir Putin,' the answer is overwhelmingly yes.

I've worked quite a lot with Russian surveys, and I think this quote from Ben Judah depicts quite accurately the most common critique of Russian surveys.

# Surveys in &amp;#127479;&amp;#127482;

### Rough division between local &amp; cross-national surveys:

.pull-left[
#### Local surveys
* Levada-Center

* VCIOM

Here are some survey organizations and programmes that operate in Russia. Quite many of you had used the Levada-Center's data in assignments, and this organization is indeed probably the most reputable Russian polling agency. However, when looking for data sources, I'd recommend you to check also the data from state-aligned polling agencies (e.g. VCIOM and FOM): sometimes their surveys contain interesting questions and figures that can tell you something about the Russian society. It's also a good practice to compare the data from different survey organizations on with similar questions to see if they paint a similar picture of the phenomenon -- but we'll get back to this soon.

Many established and high quality survey programmes operate also in Russia, and you may find interesting data from those too. Full datasets are often available only in csv or SPSS/similar statistical programme formats, but quite often you can also subset a smaller dataset of variables in Excel format from their webpages (at least World Values Survey and European Social Survey have these kind of online tools available on their webpages).

    1. Excel
    2. R

* Data visualizations are a powerful way to communicate with your data: .blue[a picture is worth a thousand words]

* Demanded and needed skill in modern research work and beyond

* If possible, .blue[always prefer visualizations over data tables]: visualizations are much more powerful and interesting way of communicating + demonstrate your methodological skills nicely!
  - NB &amp;#9757;&amp;#65039; this principle applies also to more advanced statistical analyses, like regression model results etc.

]

---

## Types of visualizations &amp;#127912; (not all-inclusive list)

####	Scatterplots
  -	Great for visualizing the relationship between two continuous (= non-categorical) variables
  -	Example visualization:
    1.	Life expectancy in years on Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2.	Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita on X-axis (the horizontal axis)

#### Line plots &amp;#128200;
  - Great for visualizing change over time
  -	Example visualization:
    1.	Life expectancy in years on Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2.	Year on X-axis (the horizontal axis)
    
---

#### Bar plots &amp;#128202;
  -	Great at comparing statistics for each of several categories
  -	Example visualization:
    1.	Fears (= categories) on the Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2.	Percentage of fears on the X-axis (the horizontal axis)

####	Histograms
  -	Great at describing the distribution of a one-dimensional numeric variable
  -	Example:
    1.	Life expectancy on the X-axis (the horizontal axis)
    2.	NB! With histograms the Y-axis is always only the number of observations on the X-axis!

#### Box plots &amp;#128230;
  -	Great at comparing the distribution of a numeric variable among several categories
  -	Example:
    1. Life expectancy on the Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2. Post-Soviet country groups on the X-axis (the horizontal axis)

- Keep it simple! &amp;#10145;&amp;#65039; for example, avoid 3D visualizations if it doesn’t add any information to the chart
  -	We human beings have difficulties to understand more than 3 dimensions, even if there are more of them
