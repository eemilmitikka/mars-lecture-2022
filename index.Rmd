Here's briefly to outline of today's lecture. 

We'll talk first briefly about the Russian survey data because 

  - this might be interesting to some of you
  
  - there are also some myths and misconceptions related to this kind of data
  
  - not very detailed examination of the topic since I believe Margarita Zavadskaya will talk about survey data later on this course
  
Next, I'll say couple of words briefly about the state statistics

Then, I'll say couple of words about international statistics related to Russia

Finally, I'll give some examples and ideas how to apply quantitative data to your own future work

Here's very shortly some historical background for surveys. 

The reason why I mention these things here is that since Russia is non-democratic country with no free press, there are often concerns in both academic and everyday discussions about the reliability and usability of Russian survey data. 

So can we relate to Russian surveys in same way as we relate to surveys conducted in democratic countries?


---

* Reliability concerns in authoritarian countries:

  2. .blue[Opinion manipulation]: state controls the main communication means
  
  3. .blue[Social desirability bias]; survey respondents hide their true opinions when answering
  
]

???

Most typically, the critique of Russian surveys comes in three forms: 

  1. Fake numbers: Russian polling agencies simply present fake numbers to bolster the legitimacy of Putin, the Kremlin and other similar power structures
  
  2. Opinion manipulation: this line of critique suggests that since there is no free media in Russia, the Kremlin can mold the opinion climate through media
  
  3. Social desirability bias: this means that Russians fear the social consequences for expressing their "true opinions", so they simply lie or embellish the truth when answering the surveys

# Surveys in &#127479;&#127482;

### Rough division between local & cross-national surveys:

.pull-left[
#### Local surveys
* Levada-Center

* VCIOM

* FOM

* Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey

* and others...
]

.pull-right[
#### Cross-national surveys

* Life in Transition Survey

* International Social Survey Programme

* and others...
]

???

Here are some survey organizations and programmes that operate in Russia. Quite many of you had used the Levada-Center's data in assignments, and this organization is indeed probably the most reputable Russian polling agency. However, when looking for data sources, I'd recommend you to check also the data from state-aligned polling agencies (e.g. VCIOM and FOM): sometimes their surveys contain interesting questions and figures that can tell you something about the Russian society. It's also a good practice to compare the data from different survey organizations on with similar questions to see if they paint a similar picture of the phenomenon -- but we'll get back to this soon.

Many established and high quality survey programmes operate also in Russia, and you may find interesting data from those too. Full datasets are often available only in csv or SPSS/similar statistical programme formats, but quite often you can also subset a smaller dataset of variables in Excel format from their webpages (at least World Values Survey and European Social Survey have these kind of online tools available on their webpages).

* I'll present some basic principles and ideas for data visualizations

* (Very) brief overview to two statistical softwares:
    1. Excel
    2. R
]


---

## Data visualizations &#127912; &#128202; &#128200;

.large[
* Data visualizations are a powerful way to communicate with your data: .blue[a picture is worth a thousand words]

* Demanded and needed skill in modern research work and beyond

* If possible, .blue[always prefer visualizations over data tables]: visualizations are much more powerful and interesting way of communicating + demonstrate your methodological skills nicely!
  - NB &#9757;&#65039; this principle applies also to more advanced statistical analyses, like regression model results etc.

]

---

## Types of visualizations &#127912; (not all-inclusive list)

####	Scatterplots
  -	Great for visualizing the relationship between two continuous (= non-categorical) variables
  -	Example visualization:
    1.	Life expectancy in years on Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2.	Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita on X-axis (the horizontal axis)

#### Line plots &#128200;
  - Great for visualizing change over time
  -	Example visualization:
    1.	Life expectancy in years on Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2.	Year on X-axis (the horizontal axis)
    
---

#### Bar plots &#128202;
  -	Great at comparing statistics for each of several categories
  -	Example visualization:
    1.	Fears (= categories) on the Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2.	Percentage of fears on the X-axis (the horizontal axis)

####	Histograms
  -	Great at describing the distribution of a one-dimensional numeric variable
  -	Example:
    1.	Life expectancy on the X-axis (the horizontal axis)
    2.	NB! With histograms the Y-axis is always only the number of observations on the X-axis!

#### Box plots &#128230;
  -	Great at comparing the distribution of a numeric variable among several categories
  -	Example:
    1. Life expectancy on the Y-axis (the vertical axis)
    2. Post-Soviet country groups on the X-axis (the horizontal axis)

## Some basic principles for visualizing data &#128161; &#9757;&#65039;

.large[
- Keep it simple! &#10145;&#65039; for example, avoid 3D visualizations if it doesn’t add any information to the chart
  -	We human beings have difficulties to understand more than 3 dimensions, even if there are more of them

-	Avoid [chartjunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk#:~:text=Chartjunk%20refers%20to%20all%20visual,the%20viewer%20from%20this%20information.) &#10145;&#65039; in short, remove any unnecessary stuff from your visualizations

  -	rule of thumb: decimals aren’t needed when you represent percentages
  
  -	even statistically speaking, max two decimals are (rarely) needed &#10145;&#65039;  adding/cutting decimals don’t affect dramatically to analysis’ results
  
- Use distinguishable &#10145;&#65039; pay also attention to accessibility issues, like color blindness

* Widely used "What You See Is What You Get" ([WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)) software

* Ok, if you 
  - have clean/almost clean data, and there's no need for a lot of data wrangling
  
  -	don’t plan to use a lot of quantitative data in your future work
  
  -	need to just make some graphs quickly and with nicely formatted existing data

## Softwares: Excel

#### Plusses &#10133;
  -	Widely used, pretty much “industry standard”
  -	You may start to use it quickly: “What You See Is What You Get” kind of interface is more intuitive for many users

#### Minuses &#10134;

-	Exclusiveness: a paid software, .blue[features may vary between Excel versions]
-	Gets .blue[slow] easily with large datasets
-	Data handling is very .blue[error-prone]
-	.blue[Poor re-usability] of analyses
-	.blue[Poor reproducibility] of analyses: leaves no traces how you draw the graph or analyzed the data
-	Very .blue[limited options for data analysis or visualizations] compared to programming languages, such as R and Python
-	Reads only Excel-formatted data, i.e. such files as .xlsx, .xls

-	Shortly about R
  -	R is a programming language &#10145;&#65039; besides of data analyses, you can do much more with it (e.g. these lecture slides were done using R, my personal [website](https://eemilmitikka.netlify.app/) is created with R)
  
  -	If you plan to use even a bit more data visualizations or analyses than what was asked for today’s lecture, .blue[I highly recommend learning the basics of R!]

## Softwares: R (and RStudio)

#### Plusses &#10133;
-	Inclusiveness: a .blue[free software], wide and friendly user community offers support with problems (Google is your best friend as an R user)
-	RStudio offers a nice user interface
-	Data handling is .blue[fully re-usable and reproducible]: anyone with the same dataset and your code can repeat your analysis and get the same results
-	.blue[Lightning fast] compared to Excel
-	.blue[Endless options for data analysis and visualizations]: your imagination is the limit here!
-	Reads pretty much .blue[any kind of data]: Excel-files (.xlsx, .xls), SPSS-files (.sav), Comma-separated values-files (.csv), text data, Stata-files (.dta)…
-	Can be used to analyze both numerical and textual data
-	.blue[Knowing R takes you further], unlike knowing exclusive softwares like Excel or SPSS

#### Minuses  &#10134;
-	Importing and handling data in R environment may feel hard in the beginning: you have to learn the basics before moving to fun stuff, like exploring and visualizing and analyzing the data

# Things to remember &#9997;

.emphasize[&#10004; If possible, .blue[compare] your data of interest with other similar data &#10145;&#65039; do they paint a similar picture of the phenomenon?

&#10004; Check the .blue[documentation of the data]; how it was produced? &#10145;&#65039;  This is especially relevant with surveys


&#10004; With surveys: pay attention to .blue[response rates], .blue[question formulations] and .blue[societal context].

&#10004; Don't trust or be skeptical with stand-alone numbers
  -	Was the same figure smaller or bigger before &#10145;&#65039; what is the overall trend?
  -	How this compares to other contexts &#10145;&#65039; is this figure higher on average, for example, in other countries?


&#10004; There is no such thing as .blue[perfect data]! &#10145;&#65039; both quantitative and qualitative data have their pros and cons &#10145;&#65039; awareness helps to avoid worst pitfalls and jumping to conclusions
